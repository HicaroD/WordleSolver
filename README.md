# WordleSolver
:green_square: A simple algorithm to solve Wordle puzzles.

## Emoji
If your terminal emulator can't display Unicode characters, such as emoji, you can install the font `noto-fonts-emoji` and restart your terminal, now you can see emojis on the screen.

## Explanations

With the Wordle dictionary on hands, I could write a fairly simple algorithm to filter the entire list of words. I didn't measure, but I'm pretty sure this algorithm is very inneficient and certainly there are plenty of better implementations of a Wordle Solver. 
In order to take a little bit more advantage, try to use some good opening words, such as "**crate**",, "**soare**" or "**crane**". If you want to know about information theory in the context of Wordle solving algorithms, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA).

Maybe in the near future, I could improve my algorithm precision by taking advantage of the list of common word and letter frequency, so I can show more precise and reliable results.
