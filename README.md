# WordleSolver
:green_square: An algorithm to solve Wordle puzzles.

### Explanations
With the Wordle dictionary on hands, I could write a fairly simple algorithm to filter the entire list of words. I didn't measure,
but I'm pretty sure this algorithm is very inneficient and there are plenty of better implementations of a Wordle Solver.

Maybe in the near future, I could improve my algorithm precision by taking advantage of the common word list and the letter frequency list, so I can show more precise and reliable results.
